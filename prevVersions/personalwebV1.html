	<h1>Declan Nelson</h1>
	<h2>Bio</h2>
		<p>
			I am currently a second year at <a href="https://www.gatech.edu" target="_blank">Georgia Tech</a> studying Computer Science with a concentration in Artificial Intelligence and CS Theory. I am currently intering at IBM Mass Labs as a backend engineer on their Data and AI team. I am passionate about artificial intelligence, machine learning, mathematics, and web development. I have deep knowledge of Java, Python, JavaScript, html, css, C, and Swift as well as Git, PyTorch, SQL, Since I started coding I have always been hungry to learn more and, more importantly, create. I hope to find a Summer 2021 software development internship where I will have ample oppurtunity to do both.
