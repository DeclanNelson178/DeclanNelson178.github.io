		<h2 id="bioTitle">About Me</h2>
		<p>
			<img id="mepic" src="/images/bio_pic.jpeg" alt="Declan Nelson">Hello, my name is Declan Nelson and I am currently a second-year at Georgia Tech studying Computer Science with a concentration in Artificial Intelligence and Theory. This specialization allows me to purse my passion for both computer science and mathematics, as well as the applications of both fields. I am currently interning this semester at IBM Mass Labs as a backend software engineer with the Data and AI team. I have previous experience in artificial intelligence research (robotics and dimension reduction algorithms) and presented some of my work at the MIT IEEE URTC conference in the fall of 2019. My primary passion is creating. I have created numerous side projects and approach every assignment, research opportunity, and internship as an opportunity to create. I love to combine my passion for creation with my interest in AI and the math behind computer science (linear algebra, algorithmic complexity, etc.). I am currently looking for an internship for the summer of 2021 which would allow me to exercise my passions.
		</p>
		<p>
			Outside of computer science, I am fascinated by Chinese language and culture. I am minoring in Mandarin and hope to someday combine my CS skills with my mandarin skills and work abroad. This summer (2020), I will be studying abroad in Shanghai, China. I am incredibly excited by this opportunity and plan to gain fluency in the language.
